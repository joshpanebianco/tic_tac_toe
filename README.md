Tic Tac Toe - Project 0

This was my first project from the Software Engineering Intensive program at General Assembly.
Some of the interesting features in this project are the CSS animationsÂ when each card flips over and how there are three versions of each card.
The overall theme and design of this game is inspired by the video games I played growing up.
